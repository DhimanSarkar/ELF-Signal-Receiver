# **50Hz Rejection Filter**
This analog filter has been desinged to eliminate the unwanted 50Hz Signal due to Power Transmission Systems.
The main goal is to use a Band Elimination/Rejection Filter (BEF/BRF) with high Q value.

# v1.1 - 48Hz Cut-Off Twin-T Notch Filter
The v1.1 Revision of the Filter design has a Notch Frequency of 48Hz. Which gives around -28dB Attenuation at 50Hz signal.
